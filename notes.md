## 🔥 Error Handling & Debugging

- Error messages are too generic, should be more specific
- Stack traces are lost during FookieError conversions
- No standard format for validation errors

## 🛡️ Type Safety Overuse of any and unsafe type assertions

Incorrect use of generic types in some cases

Record<string, any> usage is unsafe

Validations are done at runtime, some can be caught at compile-time

🔁 Lifecycle Management Poor dependency management between lifecycles

State management is fragmented

Lifecycle order is hard-coded

Each lifecycle handles errors individually, not centralized

🧪 Testing Low unit test coverage

Integration tests are insufficient

Test fixtures and mocks are inconsistent

No performance or load testing

⚡ Performance N+1 query problem

Unnecessary database operations

Caching strategy is primitive

Not optimized for bulk operations

🧱 Code Organization High risk of circular dependencies

Core package is bloated, could be more modular

Utility functions are scattered

Configuration management is overly complex

📡 API Design No API versioning

No strategy for handling breaking changes

Inadequate API documentation

Inconsistent response formats

🔐 Security Input sanitization is lacking

Potential SQL injection risks (especially in custom queries)

Role-based access control is primitive

Missing audit logging system

🔧 Maintainability Too much code duplication

Presence of magic strings

Hardcoded configurations

No clear dependency injection pattern

📈 Scalability No support for distributed systems

Missing event-driven architecture

Microservices patterns not supported

Primitive resource management

👨‍💻 Developer Experience Insufficient CLI tooling

Poor migration tooling

Missing debug utilities

Lack of documentation for development workflow

📊 Monitoring & Observability Metrics collection is insufficient

Tracing capabilities are primitive

No health check mechanism

Missing alerting system

🗄️ Database Abstraction Query builder is too basic

Inadequate transaction management

Weak database migration tooling

No connection pooling

✅ Validation & Schema Schema validations are only at runtime

Lack of framework support for custom validations

Cross-field validation is hard to implement

Inconsistent validation error handling

📦 Dependency Management No versioning strategy

Weak peer dependency management

Package structure is messy

No optimization of the dependency tree

🥇 Top Priority Areas 🧨 Error Handling & Type Safety Implement centralized error handling

Improve type safety

Adopt a robust validation framework

🚀 Performance & Scalability Introduce a proper caching strategy

Optimize database queries

Add connection pooling

Build an event system

🧪 Testing & Maintainability Increase test coverage

Restructure codebase for better organization

Improve internal documentation

Enhance developer tooling

🛡️ Security & Monitoring Perform a security audit

Add structured logging & monitoring

Improve access control

Strengthen input validation
